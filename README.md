## Women Who Code Dublin - Kafka Workshop

@author [Laura Uzcategui ](https://twitter.com/laura_uzcategui)

This repository was created to facilitate a Kafka Workshop to [WWCode Dublin community](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Dublin/).

It is composed with 3 folders

1 - [kafka-cluster](./kafka-cluster), contains the docker compose file for creating the cluster

2- [avro-schemas](./avro-schemas) contain the schema that is being used to serialize/deserialize the data to be send and consumed from Kafka

3- [data](./data) contain 2 files with fake data

4 - [producer-consumer](./producer-consumer) contains the python scripts to write a consumer and producer using the kafka-python client library.

If you wish to follow the workshop all the steps are published here:  https://wwcode-dublin.gitbook.io/kafka-workshop/

You are welcome to contribute to the repository :)
